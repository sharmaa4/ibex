# About This Fork

This is [Silogy's](https://www.silogy.io) fork of the [Ibex RISC-V Core](https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex). Silogy
maintains this fork to test Viv, its AI-powered verification engineer. For more information, please email
contact@silogy.io.

If you're here to evaluate our performance, you can start by looking at one of the test cases we've prepared by
running `./viv-demo.py`.

# Ibex RISC-V Core

Ibex is a production-quality open source 32-bit RISC-V CPU core written in
SystemVerilog. The CPU core is heavily parametrizable and well suited for
embedded control applications. Ibex is being extensively verified and has
seen multiple tape-outs. Ibex supports the Integer (I) or Embedded (E),
Integer Multiplication and Division (M), Compressed (C), and B (Bit
Manipulation) extensions.

<p align="center"><img src="doc/03_reference/images/blockdiagram.svg" width="650"></p>

Ibex was initially developed as part of the [PULP platform](https://www.pulp-platform.org)
under the name ["Zero-riscy"](https://doi.org/10.1109/PATMOS.2017.8106976), and has been
contributed to [lowRISC](https://www.lowrisc.org) who maintains it and develops it further. It is
under active development.

## Configuration

Ibex offers several configuration parameters to meet the needs of various application scenarios.
The options include different choices for the architecture of the multiplier unit, as well as a range of performance and security features.
The table below indicates performance, area and verification status for a few selected configurations.
These are configurations on which lowRISC is focusing for performance evaluation and design verification (see [supported configs](ibex_configs.yaml)).

| Config | "micro" | "small" | "maxperf" | "maxperf-pmp-bmfull" |
| ------ | ------- | --------| ----------| -------------------- |
| Features | RV32EC | RV32IMC, 3 cycle mult | RV32IMC, 1 cycle mult, Branch target ALU, Writeback stage | RV32IMCB, 1 cycle mult, Branch target ALU, Writeback stage, 16 PMP regions |
| Performance (CoreMark/MHz) | 0.904 | 2.47 | 3.13 | 3.13 |
| Area - Yosys (kGE) | 16.85 | 26.60 | 32.48 | 66.02 |
| Area - Commercial (estimated kGE) | ~15 | ~24 | ~30 | ~61 |
| Verification status | Red | Green | Green | Green |

Notes:

* Performance numbers are based on CoreMark running on the Ibex Simple System [platform](examples/simple_system/README.md).
  Note that different ISAs (use of B and C extensions) give the best results for different configurations.
  See the [Benchmarks README](examples/sw/benchmarks/README.md) for more information.
* Yosys synthesis area numbers are based on the Ibex basic synthesis [flow](syn/README.md) using the latch-based register file.
* Commercial synthesis area numbers are a rough estimate of what might be achievable with a commercial synthesis flow and technology library.
* For comparison, the original "Zero-riscy" core yields an area of 23.14kGE using our Yosys synthesis flow.
* Verification status is a rough guide to the overall maturity of a particular configuration.
  Green indicates that verification is close to complete.
  Amber indicates that some verification has been performed, but the configuration is still experimental.
  Red indicates a configuration with minimal/no verification.
  Users must make their own assessment of verification readiness for any tapeout.
* v.1.0.0 of the RISC-V Bit-Manipulation Extension is supported as well as the remaining sub-extensions of draft v.0.93 of the bitmanip spec.
  The latter are *not ratified* and there may be changes before ratification.
  See [Standards Compliance](https://ibex-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01_overview/compliance.html) in the Ibex documentation for more information.

## Documentation

The Ibex user manual can be
[read online at ReadTheDocs](https://ibex-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is also contained in
the `doc` folder of this repository.

## Examples

The Ibex repository includes [Simple System](examples/simple_system/README.md).
This is an intentionally simple integration of Ibex with a basic system that targets simulation.
It is intended to provide an easy way to get bare metal binaries running on Ibex in simulation.

A more complete example can be found in the [Ibex Demo System repository](https://github.com/lowrisc/ibex-demo-system).
In particular it includes a integration of the [PULP RISC-V debug module](https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv-dbg).
It targets the [Arty A7 FPGA board from Digilent](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-a7-artix-7-fpga-development-board/) and supports debugging via OpenOCD and GDB over USB (no external JTAG probe required).
The Ibex Demo System is maintained by lowRISC but is not an official part of Ibex.
